Step 1: Necessary technologies: 
1. Ruby (I use Ruby version 3.0.2) : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-installation.htm
2. After installing Ruby, write on the Command Prompt this line
ruby -v
If there are not any versions, it means that you have not sucessfully installed Ruby. Please try to install Ruby. If there is one, move on to the next step. Also, please take note on the version of your Ruby. 
3. Write in the Command Prompt: 
gem install rails
4. Check for the rails version by writing this line in the Command Prompt: 
rails -v
5. Download NodeJs at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Check if it is successful by entering line by line: 
node -v
npm -v 
6. Download Yarn at: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable.
Click enter for any warnings pop up. 

Step 2: Start the application: 
1. Open Gemfile in the folder. You can see on line 4, there is a line "ruby '3.0.2'". Please change 3.0.2 to your downloaded version of Ruby (on Step 1.2)
2. On the Command Prompt, write
bundle install
3. Now, you're all set. Run the application by writing on the Command Prompt: 
rails s
4. Wait for the application to run. Then, open your web browser, go to this address:
http://localhost:3000/
